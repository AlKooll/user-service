The basic message of the module is that human adversaries are what differentiates cybersecurity from other technical disciplines such as computer science, and, therefore, the concept of adversarial thinking is central to cybersecurity. The goal of the module is to produce enduring strategic-mindedness in students who may otherwise tend to equate cybersecurity with technology-based best practices. This is a stand-alone, selfcontained module, with no knowledge prerequisites. It contains three lessons of approximately one hour each. The module can be incorporated into virtually any university-level course.

motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes are ubiquitously equipped in modern smartphones.&nbsp; They have enabled mobile apps to have richer functionality and better interactivity, but have also created many new opportunities especially powerful side-channels for attackers to compromise users' security and privacy. &nbsp;This semester-long course project with five modules and eight STEPs&nbsp;aims to help undergraduate and graduate students to deeply learn advanced motion sensor based side-channel attacks and defenses on smartphones.</p>\n\n<p>The high-level <strong>learning outcomes</strong> and the corresponding <strong>assessment</strong> of this course project are summarized as follows.&nbsp; In other words, upon completion of this course project, students should be able to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Build</strong> tools to collect motion sensor data from smartphone users without any restriction like what attackers can do.\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>Assessed by the tasks and outputs specified in STEP 3.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Construct</strong> tools to preprocess smartphone motion sensor data.\n        <ul>\n            <li>Assessed by the tasks and outputs specified in STEP 4.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Design</strong> features for machine learning algorithms based on your preprocessed motion sensor data.\n        <ul>\n            <li>Assessed by the tasks and outputs specified in STEP 5.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Create</strong> powerful side-channel attacks for compromising users’ security and privacy by leveraging the collected data and machine learning techniques.\n        <ul>\n            <li>Assessed by the tasks and outputs specified in STEP 6.</li>\n

introduction to adversarial thinking, game theory, and behavioral game theory to help develop cybersecurity students’ abilities to anticipate the strategic actions of cyber adversaries, including where, when, and how they might attack, and their tactics for evading detection. The basic message of the module is that human adversaries are what differentiates cybersecurity from other technical disciplines such as computer science, and, therefore, the concept of adversarial thinking is central to cybersecurity. The goal of the module is to produce enduring strategic-mindedness in students who may otherwise tend to equate cybersecurity with technology-based best practices. This is a stand-alone, self-contained module, with no knowledge prerequisites. It contains three lessons of approximately one hour each. &nbsp;The module can be incorporated into virtually any university-level course. This module has been experimentally validated and is the subject of two peer-reviewed journal articles (cited in the syllabus).</p>\n"}],"outcomes":["5add2f1ee6b9490dd9331a38","5af9e102ec50aa101c13e5e1","5af9e12dec50aa101c13e5e2","5af9e15fec50aa101c13e5e3"],"materials":{"files":[{"id":"20a824a0-4692-11e8-b2d8-a32c43b32548","name":"Assessment Guide.docx","fileType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/shamman/5add2dc9e6b9490dd9331a37/Assessment%20Guide.docx","date":"1524445416281","timeAgo":"April 22, 2018","description":"Assessment questions with step-by-step solutions","packageable":true},{"id":"20a84bb0-4692-11e8-b2d8-a32c43b32548","name":"Data Breach Exercise -

When dealing with virtual networks, we usually need virtual switches for creating complex network topology. Virtual switching solutions like Software Defined Networking (SDN) has gained lots of attention recently for its strength in managing large and ever-changing network infrastructures. But long before SDN came into existence, Linux bridge was the prevalent virtual switching tool, and it still is nowadays. A bridge, just like a physical switch, is a device to unite network segments transparently by forwarding the network traffic from the network devices connected to it. In this lab, we will first go through some Linux networking concepts and tools which can later help us understand the way Linux bridge works. Then, we will look into Linux bridge from both application and implementation perspective.</p>\n"}],"outcomes":["5afe0642c60bc10dca10a105","5afe0642c60bc10dca10a106","5afe074dc60bc10dca10a107"],"materials":{"files":[{"id":"d3aa5c80-5a24-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Lab-Instruction.docx","fileType":"application/octet-stream","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5ade7f42d93cc80db97019e3/01__Linux-Bridge/Lab-Instruction.docx","date":"1526597488529","fullPath":"01__Linux-Bridge/Lab-Instruction.docx","timeAgo":"3 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"d3ad69c0-5a24-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Lab-Solution.docx","fileType":"application/octet-stream","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5ade7f42d93cc80db97019e3/01__Linux-Bridge/Lab-Solution.docx","date":"1526597488832","fullPath":"01__Linux-Bridge/Lab-Solution.docx","timeAgo":"3 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"d3aec950-5a24-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Linux-Bridge.json","fileType":"application/json","extension":".json","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5ade7f42d93cc80db97019e3/01__Linux-Bridge/Linux-Bridge.json","date":"1526597488935","fullPath":"01__Linux-Bridge/Linux-Bridge.json","timeAgo":"3 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"5900edc0-5a40-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","fileType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5ade7f42d93cc80db97019e3/01__Linux-Bridge/Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","date":"1526609307116","fullPath":"01__Linux-Bridge/Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","timeAgo":"14 minutes ago","packageable":true}],"urls":[{"title":"Lab01-VM-Image-1","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/images/linuxbridge/linuxbridge-vm-1.qcow2.tar.gz"},{"title":"Lab01-VM-Image-2","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/images/linuxbridge/linuxbridge-vm-2.qcow2.tar.gz"},{"title":"EZSetup-Source-Code","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/src/EZSetup-1.0.0.zip"},{"title":"EZSetup-User-Guide","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/docs/EZSetup-User-Guide__2018-04-01.pdf"}],"notes":"","folderDescriptions":[],"pdf":{"name":"0ReadMeFirst - NetSiC Labs -- Linux Bridge.pdf","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5ade7f42d93cc80db97019e3/0ReadMeFirst%20-%20NetSiC%20Labs%20--%20Linux%20Bridge.pdf"}},"published":true,"contributors":[],"collection":"nccp"},{"_id":"5adfa9b0e5b8af01c535a0ab","authorID":"5adfa742b07aa2395b4eb5ca","name":"SECURE BIG DATA ANALYTICS","date":"1528953430202","length":"module","levels":["undergraduate","graduate"],"goals":[{"text":"<p>This module incorporates topics regarding Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) such as system logging, client-server architecture, and innovative block hash key-chain sealing and unsealing around enclave structures in order to provide students with the comprehensive knowledge and experience to effectively run a new system designed to securing logging systems that use a client/server communication model.</p>\n"}],"outcomes":["5adfa9b0e5b8af01c535a0ac","5adfa9b0e5b8af01c535a0ad","5b21f37e06768b77c787ac25"],"materials":{"files":[{"id":"64a9a640-480b-11e8-b7cd-e127276d0794","name":"Assessment Quiz - Intel SGX.pdf","fileType":"application/pdf","extension":".pdf","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/latifurk/5adfa9b0e5b8af01c535a0ab/3-SGX/Assessment%20Quiz%20-%20Intel%20SGX.pdf","date":"1524607470854","fullPath":"3-SGX/Assessment Quiz - Intel SGX.pdf","timeAgo":"April 24, 2018"},{"id":"64ac1740-480b-11e8-b7cd-e127276d0794","name":"SGX-lab-solution.pdf","fileType":"application/pdf","extension":".pdf","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/latifurk/5adfa9b0e5b8af01c535a0ab/3-SGX/labs/SGX-lab-solution.pdf","date":"1524607471270","fullPath":"3-SGX/labs/SGX-lab-solution.pdf","timeAgo":"April 24, 2018"}],"urls":[],"notes":"","folderDescriptions":[{"path":"3-SGX/labs","description":"Lab Tasks"}],"pdf":{"name":"0ReadMeFirst - SECURE BIG DATA ANALYTICS.pdf","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/latifurk/5adfa9b0e5b8af01c535a0ab/0ReadMeFirst%20-%20SECURE%20BIG%20DATA%20ANALYTICS.pdf"}},"published":true,"contributors":[],"collection":"nccp"},{"_id":"5ad78d0c7de3a80dd04b0330","authorID":"5aa95a52d737bb3c41071760","name":"Basics of Fuzzing","date":"1524075788522","length":"nanomodule","levels":["undergraduate"],"goals":[{"text":"<p>Fuzzing is a proven technique for automating the process of discovering bugs in software.

Key topics include security architecture, cryptographic systems, security protocols, and security management tools. More specifically, subjects in this course include virus and worm propagation, malicious software scanning, cryptographic tools, intrusion detection, DoS, firewalls, best practices, and policy management. Project topics come from lists of problems supplied by government or industrial partners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is a case-study based course, where cases come from the recent real-life cyber security attacks including the Target breach, the Anthem breach, a 300Gbps DDoS attack and others. Students will look into the details of these attacks and learn how these attacks happened from the beginning to the end. Students are expected to analyze the case study materials and prepare for the in-class discussion. Through guided discussion and hands-on assignments, students will explore various cyber security attack techniques, defense mechanisms and best practices.</p>\n"}],"outcomes":["5ae782dcbe129c0ccafc0c9e","5ae782dcbe129c0ccafc0c9f","5ae782dcbe129c0ccafc0ca0","5ae782dcbe129c0ccafc0ca1","5ae782dcbe129c0ccafc0ca2","5ae782dcbe129c0ccafc0ca3","5ae782dcbe129c0ccafc0ca4","5ae782dcbe129c0ccafc0ca5"],"materials":{"files":[{"id":"eff5b1b0-4cb8-11e8-9afa-6780cb85507c","name":"L05_Access_control_NSA.pptx","fileType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation","extension":".pptx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/caiyusa/5ae782dbbe129c0ccafc0c9d/L05_Access_control_NSA.pptx","date":"1525121794413","timeAgo":"1

An example of a widely-used overlay network would be the Internet, which is built on the LAN (Local Area Network) by introducing various TCP/IP protocols. The advantages of using overlay networking include reusing existing network infrastructure, good scalability, and flexibility. In the context of cloud computing, network providers also utilize a broad range of overlay networks to support complex cloud networking configurations. In this lab, we will introduce two types of overlay networks that are popular in cloud data centers--GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) and VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN). Students will get to know the basic concepts of these two overlay network protocols, as well as have some hands-on experiments of managing GRE and VXLAN networks by utilizing EZSetup lab environment, Mininet, OpenVSwitch and Wireshark.</p>\n"}],"outcomes":["5afe1500c60bc10dca10a117","5afe1500c60bc10dca10a118","5afe1500c60bc10dca10a119","5afe1500c60bc10dca10a11a"],"materials":{"files":[{"id":"f2f4f200-5a2c-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Lab-Instruction.docx","fileType":"application/octet-stream","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe1328c60bc10dca10a116/05__Overlay-Networks/Lab-Instruction.docx","date":"1526600975742","fullPath":"05__Overlay-Networks/Lab-Instruction.docx","timeAgo":"4 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"f2f73bf0-5a2c-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Lab-Solution.docx","fileType":"application/octet-stream","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe1328c60bc10dca10a116/05__Overlay-Networks/Lab-Solution.docx","date":"1526600976032","fullPath":"05__Overlay-Networks/Lab-Solution.docx","timeAgo":"4 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"f2f985e0-5a2c-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Overlay-Networking.json","fileType":"application/json","extension":".json","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe1328c60bc10dca10a116/05__Overlay-Networks/Overlay-Networking.json","date":"1526600976280","fullPath":"05__Overlay-Networks/Overlay-Networking.json","timeAgo":"4 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"4dad0980-5a41-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","fileType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe1328c60bc10dca10a116/05__Overlay-Networks/Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","date":"1526609717731","fullPath":"05__Overlay-Networks/Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","timeAgo":"1 hour ago","packageable":true}],"urls":[{"title":"Lab05-Router-VM","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/images/overlaynetwork/overlaynetwork-router.qcow2.tar.gz "},{"title":"Lab05-VM-1","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/images/overlaynetwork/overlaynetwork-vm-1.qcow2.tar.gz"},{"title":"Lab05-VM-2","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/images/overlaynetwork/overlaynetwork-vm-2.qcow2.tar.gz "},{"title":"EZSetup-Source-Code","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/src/EZSetup-1.0.0.zip"},{"title":"EZSetup-User-Guide","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/docs/EZSetup-User-Guide__2018-04-01.pdf"}],"notes":"","folderDescriptions":[],"pdf":{"name":"0ReadMeFirst - NetSiC Labs -- Overlay Networking.pdf","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe1328c60bc10dca10a116/0ReadMeFirst%20-%20NetSiC%20Labs%20--%20Overlay%20Networking.pdf"}},"published":true,"contributors":[],"collection":"nccp"},{"_id":"5afb5be47ebb710dedfd41dd","authorID":"5adf48e8c073ee18f7c69f15","name":"CSP-Module 6-Lesson 3-Network defense technologies","date":"1526422500026","length":"micromodule","levels":["undergraduate"],"goals":[{"text":"<p>Topics to be covered in this lesson include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Different types of firewalls and what are the advantages of each one.</li>\n    <li>Intrusion detection systems</li>\n    <li>Intrusion prevention systems</li>\n    <li>Honeypot</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"outcomes":["5afb5be47ebb710dedfd41de","5afb5be47ebb710dedfd41df","5afb5be47ebb710dedfd41e0"],"materials":{"files":[{"id":"6ce74910-588d-11e8-b6bf-a75dd351c4e6","name":"Lesson_3_Network_defense_technologies.pptx","fileType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation","extension":".pptx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jimaf/5afb5be47ebb710dedfd41dd/Lesson_3_Network_defense_technologies.pptx","date":"1526422508990","timeAgo":"less than a minute ago","packageable":true}],"urls":[],"notes":"Please attribute Dr. Jim Alves-Foss and Dr. Jia Song, University of Idaho \nExcept where otherwise noted, this work is licensed under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/  Notwithstanding the non-commercial license terms, non-profit educational institutions are granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to adapt and use this material, with attribution. \nCreative Commons and the double C in a circle are registered trademarks of Creative commons in the United States and other countries.

In a traditional network, network security is usually enforced by the firewall on servers or dedicated networking devices. Although the firewall is widely used in personal or enterprise networks, it requires tedious configurations and is not responsive to network changes, which is a common case in cloud environments. A security group is a set of network filter rules applied to a cluster of machines, thus defines the networking access to them. The concept of security group is now adopted by many major cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, and OpenStack. In this lab, we will take a closer look at the composition of security groups, and practice managing them on the OpenStack platform using dashboard or CLI. Finally, we will help you understand the implementation details of security groups in OpenStack.</p>\n"}],"outcomes":["5afe1648c60bc10dca10a11c","5afe1648c60bc10dca10a11d","5afe1648c60bc10dca10a11e","5afe1648c60bc10dca10a11f"],"materials":{"files":[{"id":"b5527bb0-5a2d-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Lab-Instruction.docx","fileType":"application/octet-stream","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe15ebc60bc10dca10a11b/06__OpenStack-Security-Group/Lab-Instruction.docx","date":"1526601301733","fullPath":"06__OpenStack-Security-Group/Lab-Instruction.docx","timeAgo":"4 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"b5549e90-5a2d-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Lab-Solution.docx","fileType":"application/octet-stream","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe15ebc60bc10dca10a11b/06__OpenStack-Security-Group/Lab-Solution.docx","date":"1526601301943","fullPath":"06__OpenStack-Security-Group/Lab-Solution.docx","timeAgo":"4 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"b556e880-5a2d-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"OpenStack-Security-Group.json","fileType":"application/json","extension":".json","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe15ebc60bc10dca10a11b/06__OpenStack-Security-Group/OpenStack-Security-Group.json","date":"1526601302197","fullPath":"06__OpenStack-Security-Group/OpenStack-Security-Group.json","timeAgo":"4 hours ago","packageable":true},{"id":"9eb116a0-5a41-11e8-801e-eb91c6e6ba07","name":"Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","fileType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","extension":".docx","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe15ebc60bc10dca10a11b/06__OpenStack-Security-Group/Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","date":"1526609853665","fullPath":"06__OpenStack-Security-Group/Objectives-to-Exercise-Questions-Mapping.docx","timeAgo":"1 hour ago","packageable":true}],"urls":[{"title":"Lab06-Compute-VM","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/images/securitygroup/securitygroup-compute.qcow2.tar.gz "},{"title":"Lab06-Controller-VM","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/images/securitygroup/securitygroup-controller.qcow2.tar.gz"},{"title":"Lab06-Observer-VM","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/images/securitygroup/securitygroup-observer.qcow2.tar.gz"},{"title":"EZSetup-Source-Code","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/src/EZSetup-1.0.0.zip"},{"title":"EZSetup-User-Guide","url":"http://nexus-dev.host.ualr.edu/ezsetup/docs/EZSetup-User-Guide__2018-04-01.pdf"}],"notes":"","folderDescriptions":[],"pdf":{"name":"0ReadMeFirst - NetSiC Labs -- Security Group.pdf","url":"https://neutrino-file-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mengjunxie/5afe15ebc60bc10dca10a11b/0ReadMeFirst%20-%20NetSiC%20Labs%20--%20Security%20Group.pdf"}},"published":true,"contributors":[],"collection":"nccp"},{"_id":"5afe2654c60bc10dca10a131","authorID":"5ade7e61c073ee18f7c69f09","name":"NetSiC Labs -- Virtual Private Network","date":"1526617968341","length":"micromodule","levels":["undergraduate","post graduate","community college","training"],"goals":[{"text":"<p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) and its enabling technologies have been widely used for both secure remote access and evading firewall control.
